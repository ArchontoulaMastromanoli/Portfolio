                    <h3>üöÄ Bridging Technology and Society</h3>
                    <p>
                        Passionate about all things digital and driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact in the world 
                        of technology, I am on a journey to explore and excel in <strong>digital media</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>. 
                        Recently, I‚Äôve also become increasingly interested in Web3, and I‚Äôm excited to expand my knowledge in this area.

                    <h3>üéì Academic Journey</h3>
                    <p>
                        My academic journey began with a year in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, where I gained <strong>foundational programming skills</strong>. 
                        I then transitioned to <strong>Digital Media and Society</strong> to focus more on <strong>web development</strong> practices while exploring 
                        the <strong>sociological aspects of digital technology</strong>. This interdisciplinary approach has helped me understand how 
                        to design solutions that not only work but also resonate with people and their needs.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>üéì What‚Äôs Next?</h3>
                    <p>
                        After graduation, I plan to enhance my <strong>technical expertise</strong> through a <strong>master‚Äôs program</strong> in <strong>Computer Science</strong> 
                        or <strong>Software Development</strong>.These programs will deepen my practical skills and help me build on the theoretical and sociological knowledge I‚Äôve gained so far.

                <p>As a member of the <span>digital media promotion team</span> for the <span>Erasmus+ program</span>, our focus was on raising 
                    awareness for injured animal care. I led <span>innovative promotional strategies</span>, including interviews and 
                    captivating social media videos. Our efforts landed us on the <span>front page</span> of the city's newspaper, 
                    achieved through the creation of <span>eye-catching posters, flyers,</span> and <span>web-based materials</span>. 
                    <span>Collaborating </span> with individuals from <span>diverse backgrounds</span> sharpened my <span>communication</span> and <span>teamwork abilities</span>.

                    I recently participated in a <span>Blockchain Hackathon</span> as part of a small team. I was responsible for the <span>front-end development</span>, where I 
                    leveraged my <span>web development skills</span> to create a solid foundation for our project. I completed my tasks <span>ahead of schedule</span>, which allowed 
                    my teammates to start on the back-end work. My teammates were very pleased with my work, but unfortunately, due to a back-end error, we 
                    were unable to submit the project. Despite this setback, the experience was incredibly <span>rewarding</span>, and it has sparked my interest in learning 
                    more about <span>blockchain technology</span> and building <span>decentralized applications (d-apps)</span>. In the future, I would like to be able to contribute to 
                    the back-end of blockchain d-apps as well, so I can help address issues like the one we encountered in our project.
